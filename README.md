# Big-Data-Project-3
Real-Time Meetup RSPV Data Processing using Kafka and Spark
###### By: Rajkumar k

## Project Description

Spark Streaming of RSVPs from meetup.com API using Kafka meetup.com provides a streaming data of RSVPs in JSON Format.
Getting this streaming data into Apache Spark-Streaming is the first step to perform various analytics, recommendations or visualizations on the data.

## Technologies Used

* **Apache Kafka [2.8]**
Apache Kafka is a framework implementation of a software bus using stream-processing.The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.

* **Apache Spark [3.1.2]** 
Apache Spark is an open source unified analytics engine for large scale data
processing Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism
and fault tolerance.

* **Hadoop Hdfs**
HDFS is a distributed file system that handles large data sets running on commodity hardware. It is used to scale a single Apache Hadoop cluster to hundreds (and even thousands) of nodes. 

* **AWS S3**
Amazon S3 or Amazon Simple Storage Service is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface. Amazon S3 uses the same scalable storage infrastructure that Amazon.com uses to run its global e-commerce network.

* **Python [3.8]** 
Python is an interpreted high level general purpose programming language
Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant
indentation.

* **PySpark [3.1.2]** 
PySpark is an interface for Apache Spark in Python It not only allows you to
write Spark applications using Python APIs, but also provides the PySpark shell for interactively
analyzing your data in a distributed environment.

* **Git /GitHub** 
It is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control
using Git It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git.
